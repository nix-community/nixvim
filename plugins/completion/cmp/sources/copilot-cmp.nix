        Suppose you have the following code: `print('h')`.
        Copilot might try to account for the `'` and `)` and complete it with this: `print('hello`.

        This is not good behavior for consistency reasons and will just end up deleting the two ending
        characters.
        This option fixes that.
        Don't turn this off unless you are having problems with pairs and believe this might be
        causing them.
