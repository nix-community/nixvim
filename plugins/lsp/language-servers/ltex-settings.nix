      Controls whether the extension is enabled.
      Allows disabling LanguageTool on specific workspaces or for specific code language modes
      (i.e., file types).

      Either supply a boolean value stating whether LTEX is enabled for all supported markup languages
      or disabled for all of them, or supply a list of code language identifiers for which LTEX should
      be enabled (note that extensions can define additional code language identifiers).

      All supported markup languages are listed in the default value of this setting.
      In addition, LTEX can check comments in many popular programming languages like C++ or Java, if
      you add the corresponding code language identifiers to this setting.
      If you add an unsupported code language mode, LTEX will check corresponding files as plain text
      without any parsing.

      The activation events are unaffected by this setting.
      This means that the extension will be activated whenever a file with a supported code language
      mode is opened.
      For unsupported code language modes, you may need to activate the extension explicitly by
      executing the LTeX: Activate Extension command.

      Examples:
      - true
      - false
      - ["latex" "markdown"]
    '';

  language = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkStr "en-US" ''
    The language (e.g., "en-US") LanguageTool should check against.
    Use a specific variant like "en-US" or "de-DE" instead of the generic language code like "en" or
    "de" to obtain spelling corrections (in addition to grammar corrections).

    When using the language code "auto", LTEX will try to detect the language of the document.
    This is not recommended, as only generic languages like "en" or "de" will be detected and thus
    no spelling errors will be reported.

      string containing information about the rule and sentence.

      Although it is possible to manually edit this setting, the intended way is the
      `Hide false positive` quick fix.

      The JSON string currently has the form `{"rule": "<RULE>", "sentence": "<SENTENCE>"}`, where
      `<RULE>` is the ID of the LanguageTool rule and `<SENTENCE>` is a Java-compatible regular
      expression.

      tokenizer) that match the regular expression.

  fields = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable (with types; attrsOf bool) "{}" ''
    List of BibTEX fields whose values are to be checked in BibTEX files.

    This setting is an attrs with the field names as keys (not restricted to classical BibTEX
    fields) and booleans as values, where `true` means that the field value should be checked and
    `false` means that the field value should be ignored.

    Some common fields are already ignored, even if you set this setting to an empty attrs.

    Example:
    ```nix

        maintitle = false;
        seealso = true;
      }
    ```

      List of LATEX commands to be handled by the LATEX parser, listed together with empty arguments
      (e.g., `"ref{}"`, `"\documentclass[]{}"`).

      This setting is an attrs with the commands as keys and corresponding actions as values.

      If you edit the `settings.json` file directly, don’t forget to escape the initial backslash by
      replacing it with two backslashes.

      Many common commands are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an empty
      attrs.

      Example:
      ```nix
        {
          "\\label{}" = "ignore";
          "\\documentclass[]{}" = "ignore";

      List of names of LATEX environments to be handled by the LATEX parser.

      This setting is an attrs with the environment names as keys and corresponding actions as
      values.

      Some environments are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an empty
      attrs.

      Example:
      ```nix
        {

  markdown = {
    nodes = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable (with types; attrsOf str) "{}" ''
      List of Markdown node types to be handled by the Markdown parser.

      This setting is an attrs with the node types as keys and corresponding actions as values.

      The Markdown parser constructs an AST (abstract syntax tree) for the Markdown document, in
      which all leaves have node type Text.
      The possible node types are listed in the documentation of flexmark-java.

      Some common node types are already handled by default, even if you set this setting to an
      empty attrs.

      Example:
      ```nix

          FencedCodeBlock = "ignore";
          AutoLink = "dummy";

    '';

    motherTongue = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkStr "" ''
      Optional mother tongue of the user (e.g., "de-DE").

    word (whenever the editor sends a completion request).

    In VS Code, completion is enabled by default while typing (via `editor.quickSuggestions`).

      This setting can either be a string with the severity to use for all diagnostics, or an attrs
