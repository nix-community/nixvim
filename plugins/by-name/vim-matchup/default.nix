      When enabled (the default), the plugin will be loaded for all buffers, including ones without

              Sets the method to use to show off-screen matches.
              Possible values are:

              - `"status"` (default): Replace the |status-line| for off-screen matches.\
                If a match is off of the screen, the line belonging to that match will be displayed
                syntax-highlighted in the status line along with the line number (if line numbers
                are enabled).
                If the match is above the screen border, an additional `Î”` symbol will be shown to
                indicate that the matching line is really above the cursor line.
              - `"status_manual"`: Compute the string which would be displayed in the status-line or
                popup, but do not display it.
                The function `MatchupStatusOffscreen()` can be used to get the text.
              - `"popup"`: Use a floating window to show the off-screen match.
            '';
          };

          scrolloff = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
            When enabled, off-screen matches will not be shown in the statusline while the cursor is
            at the screen edge (respects the value of `'scrolloff'`).

            This is intended to prevent flickering while scrolling with `j` and `k`.
          '';

    matchparen_insert_timeout = defaultNullOpts.mkUnsignedInt 60 ''
      Adjust the timeouts in milliseconds for highlighting.
    '';

    matchparen_deferred = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      Deferred highlighting improves cursor movement performance (for example, when using `|hjkl|`)
      by delaying highlighting for a short time and waiting to see if the cursor continues moving.
    '';

    matchparen_deferred_show_delay = defaultNullOpts.mkUnsignedInt 50 ''
      Delay, in milliseconds, between when the cursor moves and when we start checking if the cursor
      is on a match.

      Applies to both making highlights and clearing them for deferred highlighting.
    '';

    matchparen_deferred_hide_delay = defaultNullOpts.mkUnsignedInt 700 ''
      If the cursor has not stopped moving, assume highlight is stale after this many milliseconds.

      Stale highlights are hidden.
    '';

    matchparen_deferred_fade_time = defaultNullOpts.mkUnsignedInt 0 ''
      When set to `{time}` in milliseconds, the deferred highlighting behavior is changed in two
      ways:

      1. Highlighting of matches is preserved for at least `{time}` even when the cursor is moved
        away.
      2. If the cursor stays on the same match for longer than `{time}`, highlighting is cleared.

      The effect is that highlighting occurs momentarily and then disappears, regardless of where
      the cursor is.
      It is possible that fading takes longer than `{time}`, if vim is busy doing other things.

      This value should be greater than the deferred show delay.
    '';

    matchparen_pumvisible = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 1 ''
      If set to `1`, matches will be made even when the `|popupmenu-completion|` is visible.

      If you use an auto-complete plugin which interacts badly with matching, set this option to
      `0`.

      example = "vV\<c-v>";
      description = ''
        When not empty, match highlighting will be disabled in the specified modes, where each mode
        is a single character like in the `|mode()|` function.

        E.g., to disable highlighting in insert mode,
        ```nix
        matchparen_nomode = "i";
        ```
        and in visual modes,
        ```nix
        matchparen_nomode = "vV\<c-v>";
        ```

        Note: In visual modes, this takes effect only after moving the cursor.
      '';
    };

    matchparen_hi_surround_always = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      Always highlight the surrounding words, if possible.
      This is like `|<plug>(matchup-hi-surround)|` but is updated each time the cursor moves.

      This requires deferred matching (`matchparen_deferred = 1`).
    '';

    matchparen_hi_background = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      Highlight buffer background between matches.
      This uses the `MatchBackground` highlighting group and is linked to `ColorColumn` by default.
    '';

    matchparen_end_sign = defaultNullOpts.mkStr "â—€" ''
      Configure the virtual symbol shown for closeless matches in languages like C++ and python.

      ```cpp
      if (true)
        cout << "";
      else
        cout << ""; â—€ if
      ```
    '';

    motion_override_Npercent = defaultNullOpts.mkUnsignedInt 6 ''
      In vim, `{count}%` goes to the `{count}` percentage in the file (see `|N%|`).
      match-up overrides this motion for small `{count}` (by default, anything less than 7).

      - For example, to allow `{count}%` for `{count}` less than 12, set it to `11`.
      - To disable this feature, and restore vim's default `{count}%`, set it to `0`.
      - To always enable this feature, use any value greater than 99.
    '';

    motion_cursor_end = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 1 ''
      If enabled, cursor will land on the end of mid and close words while moving downwards
      (`|%|/|]%|`).
      While moving upwards (`|g%|`, `|[%|`) the cursor will land on the beginning.
      Set to `0` to disable.

      Note: this has no effect on operators: `d%` will delete `|inclusive|` of the ending word (this
      is compatible with matchit).
    '';

    delim_count_fail = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      When disabled (default), giving an invalid count to the `|[%|` and `|]%|` motions and the text
      objects `|i%|` and `|a%|` will cause the motion or operation to fail.

      When enabled, they will move as far as possible.

      Note: targeting high counts when this option is enabled can become slow because many positions
      need to be tried before giving up.
    '';

    text_obj_linewise_operators = defaultNullOpts.mkListOf types.str [ "d" "y" ] ''
      Modifies the set of operators which may operate line-wise with `|i%|` (see
      `|matchup-feat-linewise|`).

      You may use `"v"`, `"V"`, and `"\<c-v>"` (i.e., an actual CTRL-V character) to specify the
      corresponding visual mode.

      You can also specify custom plugin operators with 'g@' and optionally, an expression separated
      by a comma.
    '';

    surround_enabled = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      Enables the surround module which provides maps `|ds%|` and `|cs%|`.
    '';

    override_vimtex = defaultNullOpts.mkFlagInt 0 ''
      By default, match-up is disabled for tex files when the plugin `|vimtex|` is detected.

      To enable match-up for tex files, set this option to `1`.
      This will replace vimtex's built-in highlighting and `%` map.

      Note: matching may be computationally intensive for complex LaTeX documents.
      If you experience slowdowns, consider also setting `matchparen_deferred` to `1`.
