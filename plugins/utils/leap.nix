      maxPhaseOneTargets = helpers.mkNullOrOption types.int ''
        By default, the plugin shows labels and/or highlights matches right after the first input
        character.
        This option disables ahead-of-time displaying of target beacons beyond a certain number of
        phase one targets (to mitigate visual noise in extreme cases).
        Setting it to 0 disables two-phase processing altogether.
      '';

      highlightUnlabeledPhaseOneTargets = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkBool false ''
        Whether to highlight unlabeled (i.e., directly reachable) matches after the first input
        character.
      '';

      maxHighlightedTraversalTargets = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkInt 10 ''
        Number of targets to be highlighted after the cursor in `|leap-traversal|` mode (when there
        are no labels at all).
      '';

      caseSensitive = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkBool false ''
        Whether to consider case in search patterns.
      '';

      equivalenceClasses =
        helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable
        (
          with types;
            listOf
            (
              either
              str
              (listOf str)
            )
        )
        ''[" \t\r\n"]''
        ''
          A character will match any other in its equivalence class. The sets can
          either be defined as strings or tables.

          Example:
          ```nix
            [
              "\r\n"
              ")]}>"
              "([{<"
              [ "\"" "'" "`" ]
            ]
          ```

          Note: Make sure to have a set containing `\n` if you want to be able to
          target characters at the end of the line.

          Note: Non-mutual aliases are not possible in Leap, for the same reason
          that supporting |smartcase| is not possible: we would need to show two
          different labels, corresponding to two different futures, at the same
          time.
        '';

      substituteChars = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable (with types; attrsOf str) "{}" ''
        The keys in this attrs will be substituted in labels and highlighted matches by the given
        characters.
        This way special (e.g. whitespace) characters can be made visible in matches, or even be
        used as labels.

        Example: `{"\r" = "Â¬";}`
      '';

      safeLabels =
        helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable
        (with types; listOf str)
        ''["s" "f" "n" "u" "t" "/" "S" "F" "N" "L" "H" "M" "U" "G" "T" "?" "Z"]''
        ''
          When the number of matches does not exceed the number of these "safe" labels plus one, the
          plugin jumps to the first match automatically after entering the pattern.
          Obviously, for this purpose you should choose keys that are unlikely to be used right
          after a jump!

          Setting the list to `[]` effectively disables the autojump feature.

          Note: Operator-pending mode ignores this, since we need to be able to select the actual
          target before executing the operation.
        '';

      labels =
        helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable
        (with types; listOf str)
        ''
          [
            "s" "f" "n" "j" "k" "l" "h" "o" "d" "w" "e" "m" "b" "u" "y" "v" "r" "g" "t" "c" "x" "/"
            "z" "S" "F" "N" "J" "K" "L" "H" "O" "D" "W" "E" "M" "B" "U" "Y" "V" "R" "G" "T" "C" "X"
            "?" "Z"
          ]
        ''
        ''
          Target labels to be used when there are more matches than labels in
          `|leap.opts.safe_labels|` plus one.

          Setting the list to `[]` forces autojump to always be on (except for Operator-pending
          mode, where it makes no sense).
          In this case, do not forget to set `special_keys.next_group` to something "safe" too.
