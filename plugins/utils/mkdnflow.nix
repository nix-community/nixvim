          A matching extension will enable the plugin's functionality for a file with that
          extension.

          NOTE: This functionality references the file's extension. It does not rely on
          Neovim's filetype recognition.
          The extension must be provided in lower case because the plugin converts file names to
          lowercase.
          Any arbitrary extension can be supplied.
          Setting an extension to `false` is the same as not including it in the list.

          - `true`: Changes in perspective will be reflected in the nvim working directory.
            (In other words, the working directory will "heel" to the plugin's perspective.)
            This helps ensure (at least) that path completions (if using a completion plugin with
            support for paths) will be accurate and usable.

          - `true`: When `perspective.priority` is also set to `root` (and a root directory was

        implicitExtension = helpers.mkNullOrOption types.str ''
          A string that instructs the plugin (a) how to interpret links to files that do not have

        '';

          helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkStrLuaFnOr (types.enum [false])
          "false"
          ''
            A function that transforms the text to be inserted as the source/path of a link when a
            link is created.
            Anchor links are not currently customizable.
            If you want all link paths to be explicitly prefixed with the year, for instance, and
            for the path to be converted to uppercase, you could provide the following function
            under this key.
            (NOTE: The previous functionality specified under the `prefix` key has been migrated
            here to provide greater flexibility.)

            Example:
            ```lua
              function(input)
                  return(string.upper(os.date('%Y-')..input))
              end
            ```
          '';

        transformImplicit =
          helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkStrLuaFnOr (types.enum [false])
          ''
            function(text)
                text = text:gsub(" ", "-")
                text = text:lower()
                text = os.date('%Y-%m-%d_')..text
                return(text)
            end
          ''
          ''
            A function that transforms the path of a link immediately before interpretation.
            It does not transform the actual text in the buffer but can be used to modify link
            interpretation.
            For instance, link paths that match a date pattern can be opened in a `journals`
            subdirectory of your notebook, and all others can be opened in a `pages` subdirectory,
            using the following function:

            ```lua
              function(input)
                  if input:match('%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d') then
                      return('journals/'..input)
                  else
                      return('pages/'..input)
                  end
              end
            ```
          '';
      };

      toDo = {
        symbols = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkNullable (with types; listOf str) ''[" " "-" "X"]'' ''
          A list of symbols (each no more than one character) that represent to-do list completion
          statuses.
          `MkdnToggleToDo` references these when toggling the status of a to-do item.
          Three are expected: one representing not-yet-started to-dos (default: `' '`), one
          representing in-progress to-dos (default: `-`), and one representing complete to-dos
          (default: `X`).

          NOTE: Native Lua support for UTF-8 characters is limited, so in order to ensure all
          functionality works as intended if you are using non-ascii to-do symbols, you'll need to
          install the luarocks module "luautf8".

          Whether parent to-dos' statuses should be updated based on child to-do status changes

          - `true` (default): Parent to-do statuses will be inferred and automatically updated
            when a child to-do's status is changed
          - `false`: To-do items can be toggled, but parent to-do statuses (if any) will not be
            automatically changed
        '';

        notStarted = helpers.defaultNullOpts.mkStr " " ''
          This option can be used to stipulate which symbols shall be used when updating a parent
          to-do's status when a child to-do's status is changed.
          This is **not required**: if `toDo.symbols` is customized but this option is not
          provided, the plugin will attempt to infer what the meanings of the symbols in your list
          are by their order.

          For example, if you set `toDo.symbols` as `[" " "⧖" "✓"]`, `" "` will be assiged to
          `toDo.notStarted`, "⧖" will be assigned to `toDo.inProgress`, etc.
          If more than three symbols are specified, the first will be used as `notStarted`, the
          second will be used as `inProgress`, and the last will be used as `complete`.
          If two symbols are provided (e.g. `" ", "✓"`), the first will be used as both
          `notStarted` and `inProgress`, and the second will be used as `complete`.

          `toDo.notStarted` stipulates which symbol represents a not-yet-started to-do.
