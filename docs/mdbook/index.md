## Welcome to the docs!

Over to the left, you'll find the sidebar. There you'll see several "User guides" (including an [FAQ](./user-guide/faq.md)), along with pages for various "options".

While you can search our main docs using the <i class="fa fa-search"></i> icon, if you're looking for a specific option you may find the dedicated [Nixvim Option Search](./search/index.html) (at the bottom of the sidebar) has more relevant results.

> [!TIP]
> Any page with a ❱ icon next to it has one-or-more _sub-pages_.
